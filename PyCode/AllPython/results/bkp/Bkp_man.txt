Backup 1:
******************************
- First output
- Some problems with multinomial + bin > 40
- Max number of iterations when creating the model is very low

Backup 2:
******************************
- First parallel execution
- No problem with multimodal with bin > 40
- Max iterations fixed

Backup 3:
******************************
- Multimodal hyperparameters improved??

Backup 4:
******************************
- Built hierarchical model using binary (one vs. rest) models

Backup 5:
******************************
- Added Weight analysis
- Added Weight vs. Variable p-val analysis
- Added object classification by EP presence/absence
[EMG RAW BOXPLOT IS WRONG SOMEHOW]

Backup 6:
******************************
- Added Tactile Data
- Added Tactile Data to Multimodal
- Added Tactile Data to Hierarchical

Backup 7:
******************************
- Added object classification by EP duration

Backup 8:
******************************
- Added object classification by EP number of ocurrences
- Splitted EP classification into given object, asked object and family
- Added random classifiers
- Added statistical test over classifiers' accuracies

Backup 9:
******************************
- Add hierarchichal and multimodal for all source combinations
- Add statistical analysis on classification accuracy difference

Backup 10:
******************************
- Added synergy extraction (PCA for all sources, all subjects together)
- Syn classification (C and L1vL2 fixed as in raw hierarchical)

Backup 11:
******************************
- Now we extract best C and L1 for each source in single source synergy classification to be used in hierarchical classification
- Iteration over C in hierarchical classification
- Added results from hierarchical with fixed C and L1
- Added plots comparing single source classification accuracy between raw and synergies (progressively discarding)

Backup 12:
******************************
- Added synergy classification discarding the most relevant synergies
- Added synergy classification discarding random synergies

Backup 13:
******************************
- Variance accounted for each synergy is computed properly
- Partial results, since we are now discarding 'ep + ep' movements, we don't need these results anymore

Backup 14:
******************************
- Early Enclosure is now computed as "PCA, clustering and then extraction of early enclosure"
- Raw results are not right. Wrong execution
- Not computed the hierarchical results for each subject + clustering discarding the most relevant synergies

Backup 15:
******************************
- Entire pipeline with all results
- Code has been refactored

Backup 16:
******************************
- Results discarding subjects 7-9

Backup 17:
******************************
- Single source results for raw data, discarding subj 7-9, targeting 'Family' instead of 'Given Object', old style = {50000 max iter, iteration over 'family' is fake}

Backup 18:
******************************
- Classification results targeting EP using synergy scores and synergy scores + subjects. Classes are not balanced so results probably are not accurate. 
- Made alternative clustering that works worse than early version.

Backup 19:
******************************
- Results targeting EP from syn scores and raw data, with and without using subject label also. Now classes are balanced.
- For syn score classifiers we see they don't converge (it also happens with raw data but not that often).
- Implemented plot function to show difference in EP classifier accuracies.
